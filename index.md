# LARA CROFT
## strong, intelligent yet fierce beauty
### An inspiring female character

Lady Lara Croft (born 14 February 1968) is a British archaeologist and treasure hunter, most commonly known for her discovery of several noted artefacts, including Excalibur, the fabled sword of King Arthur.
Born to an aristocratic family, Lara is generally disinterested in upper class society, finding it stifling and boring. She takes far more interest in delving into the secrets of the past and finding what is believed to not even exist.
